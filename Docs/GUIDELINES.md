# Backend
The backend is written in python.
As such we have decided to utilize [PEP8 Guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

# Frontend
The frontend is written in javascript / typescript.

As such we have decided to utilize [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)
We found that despite being a set of guidelines for typescript, it is also effective for javascript when
removing the type system related parts.

# Git
Regarding git guidelines, for commits we will be using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Our primary goal with conventional commits is to encourage developers to think about their commit messages.

On top of conventional commits, we use this post as a guide [Conventional Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)

Regarding branches and forks, we have decided to embrace [Trunk-based Development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)
generally branches bring more harm than good in most environments. We hope that committing frequently to the trunk will help ensure up to date
working trees and minimize the time spent managing merge conflicts.
